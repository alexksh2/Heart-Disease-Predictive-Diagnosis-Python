# Heart_Disease_Predictive_Diagnosis
According to the World Health Organisation, cardiovascular disease are the most significant cause of mortality annually as it results in the deaths of __approximately  17.9 million individuals every year__ (World Health Organization, 2019). While __the healthcare industry generates substantial data__ on patients, diseases and diagnosis, it is found that __these data are not properly analysed__.  (Hassan, 2022) <br>

The key root cause for heart disease often in the context of __sex, smoking, age, family history, poor diet, cholesterol, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, overweightness, and alcohol use.__ <br>

Therefore, the objective of this study is to effectively predicting the presence of coronary heart disease using machine learning classifiers such as __Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Classification and Regression Tree and Random Forest__.

# The Dataset

__Content__ <br>
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease. <br>



# Model Results

__Intrepretation of Model Results:__ <br>
The analytical results found that __Decision Tree and Random Forest Model has the highest predictive accuracy on heart disease predictive diagnosis__ as both have the highest F1 score, precision_score, recall_score, roc_auc_score and lowest log-loss as compared to __Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours, Kernel SVM, Random Forest Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier__

For neural network models, it is observed that accuracy increases as number of epochs increases
